// from Microsoft docs:

// Query syntax and method sytax are semantically identical.
// but many people find query syntax simpler and easier to read
// Some queries must be expressed as method calls
// For example, you must use a method call to express a query
// that retrieves the number of elements that match a specified condition

// use an extension method on query variable
